1) I HAVE USED 2 PASS PARSER
2) IN FIRST PASS I HAVE SEEN THAT SYNTAX IS VALID FOR ALL PARSER AND OUTPUT TREE IS SIMPLE TREE WITH NO PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY FIXED
3) IN FIRST PASS I HAVE USED LL1 PARSER
3) IN SECOND PASS I HAVE USED OPERATOR PRECEDENCE PARSER FOR EXPRESSION AND COMBINED FORM OF OPERATOR PRECEDENCE AND LL1 FOR GENERATING ABSTRACT TREE 
4) WE CAN ALSO GENERATE PARSE TREE FROM THIS SECOND PASS, BUT EXAMPLE GIVEN IS ABSTRACT TREE SO I HAVE GENERATED PARSE TREE DIRECTLY IN THIS PASS
5) NOTE WHILE GENERATING ABSTRACT TREE I HAVE REMOVED BRACKETS ( )
6) RECURSIVE LET IS NOT ALLOWED
7) RECURSIVE IF IS ALLOWED BUT IT SHOUD BE LIKE HASKELL FORM IF THEN ELSE IF THEN ELSE FI  
8) END IS FOLLOWED BY EOF IN OUR GRAMMAR
9) EVERY ASSIGNMENT STATMENT SHOULD END WITH ; EOS
10) REST EXPRESSION DO NOT END WITH ; EOS 
11) I HAVE ASSUMED TRUE AND FALSE AS CONSTANT AS GIVEN IN QUESTION
12) BOOLEAN AND NUM EVALUATION WILL BE DONE AT SEMANTICS STAGE


**************************HOW TO MAKE EXECUTABLE AND RUN PROGRAMME******************************
 
a)	RUN alex lexer.x -o LEXER.hs
b) 	RUN ghc --make parser.hs -o a2
c) 	RUN ./parser ./INPUT/input
		HERE ./PARSE IS OUTPUT FILE NAME AND ./INPUT/input IS FILE LOCATION AND FILE 		NAME PASSED AS ARGUMENTS
		
	OR
a)	RUN make
b)	RUN make run
